trakR
===================

This app was created for the 2014 Fanshawe College TD Coding Challenge.  The challenge was centered around the idea of financial information and location services.

Information
-------------
trakR allows you to add your bank accounts to your trakR account.  Once an account is added, you can then create 'Check-Ins'.  When checking in, trakR will find the nearest merchants based on your location.  You select a merchant and then enter the amount of money spent, than the check in is saved to be tracked and viewed later.
